## Problem Statement 

1.Analyze how socioeconomic status influences health outcomes such as quality of life, stress levels, and mental health.

2.Investigate the relationship between physical activity, dietary habits, and quality of life.

3.Examine how family medical history relates to the prevalence of chronic medical conditions.

4.Assess the impact of geographic location on healthcare access, insurance status, and patient outcomes.

5.Explore the effects of substance use on both mental and physical health.

  ## Project Overview

  ## Findings

  1.The average age of the patients is 51 years.
  
  2.33% of the patients are from the Black community. Other ethnic groups include Asian, White, and Hispanic.
  
  3.A significant number of patients have a family history of heart disease, making it a prevalent condition across the patient pool.
  
  4.50% of the patients do not have health insurance, indicating a potential barrier to accessing healthcare services.
  
  5.Insulin is the most commonly used medication among the patients. 30U drug is also widely prescribed and used.
  
  6.60% of the patients reside in urban areas. Patients from urban areas tend to have a higher socioeconomic support compared to those from rural areas.
  

  ## Solution

  1.Given that most patients are insulin users, there is a need to enhance the supply and availability of insulin to meet demand.
  
  2.Address the gap in mental health services by providing access to high-quality mental health care, particularly for patients showing signs of poor mental health.
  
  3.As the 30U drug is widely used, ensuring a consistent and improved supply of this medication is crucial.
  
  4.Given the prevalence of heart disease in the family history of many patients, patients should be informed about the risks and encouraged to take proactive steps to manage their heart health.
  
  5.With many patients experiencing fatigue symptoms, developing and offering better treatment options for fatigue is important to enhance patient well-being and quality of life.
